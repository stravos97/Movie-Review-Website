# Movie-Review-Website

Web application allows users to register, log in/out, create, view and edit movie reviews. The information about the review includes movie title, director, list of actors,
running time, reviewer and the actual review. 

Key features implemented:

Non-authenticated users should not be able to write/edit reviews but should be able to read them.

The application should allow multiple users to review a single movie. Thus, meaning a user should be able to add a movie if it does not exist, and then other people should be able to write
reviews about that movie that has been created.

The application should be well-structured, implementing:

• Multiple role levels (e.g. user, moderator and administrator)
• Search functionality
• Review rating system
• Image upload
